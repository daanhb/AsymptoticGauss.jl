# AsymptoticGaussianQuadrature.jl

This package assembles a few known asymptotic expansions of Gaussian quadrature
rules.

The code accompanies the paper "Arbitrary-order asymptotic expansions of Gaussian quadrature rules with classical and generalised weight functions", available on the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11423).

The main code is implemented in Julia as a package. In addition, the sage/ folder contains Sage worksheets (see sagemath.org) which construct asymptotic expansions of nodes and weights of Gaussian quadrature rules. The procedure is explained in detail in sage/procedureForAsymptotics.pdf. A description of the mathematics underlying the methodology is summarised in the paper.
